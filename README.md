## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

I learnt more about making pages responsive and changing flex flow, although, i could have used the grid option, but i chose to use flex, because i have always love using flex option.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  
}
```

### Continued development

I am still having lil issues with media queries, for responsive landing page.. i hope to improve in this regard and looking forward to ha dle many other projects.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for media query. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
